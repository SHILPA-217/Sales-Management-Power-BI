by)

2) Create a pie & Donut chart
where Region wise you will
display highest bank balance. (bank
data sets.

3) create donut chart to print
city wise every sales incentive.


4) Create a clustered column/ any
column chart using group by
(where city wise
display the total
incentive, highest incentive,
lowest incentive and
average incentive) (save in a
separate power bi file)
background chart, legends,
title, legend tile.
slicer in the column chart
of good colour with shading. (any
slicer)

5) create a merge query :
where you will display all
those customers who are
performing
(customer and order)

6) create a merge query where you
will display all those
salespeople who are not
performing(salespeople,
customers)

7) create a bar chart where you
will print the total orders, highest,
average, minimum orders and total
no of orders in each region. (5 group by
functions) (bank customers data
set(and add button slicer with
(Q & A Visualization options)

8) Create a line chart using
sales target data set
and print the comparison of
highest, lowest and actual sales
using (button and regular
slicer)

9) create a dash board which will
have pie and donut chart.
region bank balance and
gender bank balance. (bank
customers:- dataset)
and you will also have (slicer and q and a.)

10 a) create a copy of sales ppl
data set
and you will create 5 Dax
function.
(lowest sales, highest sales,
average sales, total no sales
ppl,
and total incentive, )
and 3 Dax functions to be

and 2 Dax functions to
be the stored in measure and
create funnel chart.

clustered column & line chart
and store in a new power bi
file to create a separate
dashboard and add normal slicer to
it.

11) create a new of power bi for
multi row record
and another page in the same
dashboard will have tables.
(this data is from
order table)

12) create a Kpi chart using
(Sales_target data sets)

13) prepare a gauge chart with
sales_target data sets /data
sets.

file and apply condition
columns, indexing and split
column concepts.

16) In bank customer data sets,
remove 100 rows and then
remove last 457 rows.
and applying sorting on region
column and then split the column of
job classification after making a
duplicate copy of the column and split
the column by the 1st delimiter
called space and also apply indexing.
and applying conditional
column on bank balance column.

17) Direct query steps for
connecting Bank customer :-
datasets.
